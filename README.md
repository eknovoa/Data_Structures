# Data_Structures


Stacks:
Time Complexity - O(1) for push and pop operations on an array-based stack implementation.

Applications of Stack Data Structure:
- Reversing a word
- Checking for palindromes
- Recursive Algorithms
- In compilers when converting an infix expression to a prefix or postfix form.
- In web browsers, when the back button is pressed it saves all of the previously visited URL's into a stack. Whenever you visit a new page, the URL is added on top of the stack. When you press the back button, the URL at the top of the stack is popped off, removed from the stack, and the previous URL is accessed.
